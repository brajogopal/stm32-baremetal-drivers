# STM32 Bare-Metal Drivers
Learn STM32 from scratch with clean, fully-documented register-level drivers.
Ideal for beginners, students, and embedded engineers building their own ecosystem.


📌 Why This Repository Exists

This project is built to help anyone understand how microcontrollers really work internally, without relying on HAL or CubeMX.
Every peripheral is built from the reference manual, using pure register programming.

This repo is designed to be:

✔ Beginner-friendly

✔ Easy to navigate

✔ Industry-standard structure

✔ Ideal for interviews & portfolio

✔ Expandable for future MCUs (F1, F4, G4, L0, etc.)
