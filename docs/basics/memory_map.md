*RCC Module - 
-> Rcc module enabale Bus to carry clock signals

*why BUS ? 
-> BUS Carries clock to the peripheral

*IN hexa-decimal number left side zeros of a number does not matter
like (0x0000 2000) and (0x2000) is same

*Inside the GPIO folder, in the project named “01_GPIO_toggle_addr”, you’ll find an example showing how to write code from scratch by creating symbolic names for the registers using their addresses taken from the reference manual.and on the project "02_GPIO_toggle_addr" you will see how to achive same thing by using stracture.
