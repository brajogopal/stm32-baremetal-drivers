*RCC Module - 
-> RCC module enables the Bus to carry clock signals

*Why BUS ? 
-> BUS Carries the clock to the peripheral

*IN a hexadecimal number, the left side zeros of a number do not matter
like (0x0000 2000) and (0x2000) is same

*As for hardware, I used a 48-pin breakout PCB and STM32F030 microcontroller.
